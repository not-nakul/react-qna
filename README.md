# React QnA Application
QnA application built using ReactJS, done as a part of an assessment.

# About the project and its features:
- an online assessment / QnA web application built using core React and ReactDOM without installing any other libraries
- the bundler that I have used is Parcel
- used useEffect, useContext, and useState hooks, and the React Context API
- for the styling, I have used vanilla CSS with CSS modules
- implemented a homepage with a set of instructions about the assessment
- the assessment is time-based
- auto submission after the timer expires
- ability to go back to the previous questions
- implemented navigation to jump between questions
- ability to edit choices
- navigation shows which question has been marked already
- the assessment can only be submitted once all the choices have been marked
- a scorecard is displayed once the assessment is submitted
- ability to retake the assessment
